        <h2>Patrick Udenyi, Sharicka Zutshi, David Zhong, Kayla Leiber, Edward Bian</h2>
        <p>In this project we use R to analyze the distribution of health care expenditure between different countries
            as a percentage of the country's total GDP. We got the data from the World Bank and used various box-plots
            and a QQplot to visualize the data. We also use the Kruskal Wallis test to test whether there is a
            significant
            difference in health care expenditure between high-income, medium-income, and low-income countries. Click
